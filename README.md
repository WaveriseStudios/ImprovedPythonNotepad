# ImprovedPythonNotepad
This is a simple notepad that will be updated as much as possible.
This project was something I worked on for my Computer Science class after we learned about APIs. We were given the freedom to choose a project, and I decided to create a tool that combines several interesting features like voice recognition, text-to-speech, and file management, all within a simple graphical interface. My goal was to practice using APIs and strengthen my Python skills by building something practical and interactive.

Key features :

# Save: Saves the current text to a file.

# Open: Opens an existing text file and displays its content in the text area.

# Dictate: Starts the voice recognition process, allowing the user to speak and have it converted into text or issue a command like opening a website.

# Read: Makes the app read the text aloud.


# Just make sure all dependencies are installed for python as modules. You can quickly install them via PIP :

Tkinter
PyAudio
SpeechRecognition
pyttsx3
webbrowser
time
urllib
